# Meta-Prompting is All You Need

Meta-prompting is the process of using AI to improve AI prompts, creating a self-refining system that enhances its own problem-solving capabilities.

### Key aspects:
- It's a self-improvement process. 

- It involves using AI to enhance AI instructions.

- It's aimed at improving problem-solving abilities.

- It creates a cycle of continuous refinement.

## Inspiration
Recent DeepMind paper on meta-prompting: [PromptBreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement via Prompt Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16797)

Problem: hand-crafted prompt-strategies are often sub-optimal

Solution: a general-purpose self-referential self improvement mechanism that evolves and adapts prompts for a given domain

Our approach:

- Tested how meta-prompts affect AI problem-solving
- Used 9x9 Sudoku as benchmark (25 iterations)
- Results: 12% solve rate increase with basic meta-prompting
- Interestingly, more complex prompts showed no additional improvement

Next steps: Further experiments on nested prompting structures, auto-generating few-shot examples, and multi-step iterative prompting (chains, trees, graphs)
